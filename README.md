# Glide

### What is it?

Glide is a management tool for frontend apps which allows you to perform virtually any operations you would through your hosting service.
Glide can seamlessly integrate with the following cloud services:
- AWS S3
- Netlify
- Vercel
- Digital Ocean
- Azure

Glide enables you to migrate your applications from one cloud service to another with just one cli command.

### Why?

Think about this, you have just created a big frontend application in react which uses Netlify serverless functions. Now you face some problem with Netlify as your cloud service provider. How would you migrate your entire frontend infrastructure? Enter Glide. With Glide you would only need to manage one configuration file and everything else will be managed by Glide.

### Analytics

Using Glide, you can see analytics for you frontend applications, moreover, you will be able to access user/team analytics as well.

### Webhooks

Glide supports hooks but only for Netlify right now. If you do migrate to Netlify, then you would be able to set and remove hooks from the cli itself.
